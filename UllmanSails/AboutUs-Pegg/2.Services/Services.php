    <p>
      Jon grew up messing about in boats on the River Yealm — which, conveniently, is not far from our Plympton loft in Plymouth. He’s been sailing since he could walk, trained in yacht and boatbuilding, and soon realised there’s no better place to be than on the water.<br><br>
      His sailing CV is as broad as it is impressive. He’s managed race boats, captained charter yachts (including a 72’ ketch), sold yachts, and spent seven years as Trade Account Manager at Allspars, where he developed a solid technical knowledge of rigging and deck hardware. Before that, he worked with Performance Yacht Brokers and ran charter bases for Sunsail — giving him a customer service grounding that shows in every conversation.<br><br>
      Jon joined Ullman Sails in 2016 and now heads up our Plympton loft. His practical approach, deep knowledge of race boats, and refreshingly direct manner make him an ideal fit for the team and a favourite with our regular clients.<br><br>
      When it comes to racing, Jon has plenty of time at the sharp end — from helming Farr 45s and racing J/133 to being tactician in the 2012 Commodores Cup-winning British team. He also has multiple class and overall wins at Torbay and Dartmouth Regattas. These days you’ll find him on everything from Ker 40s and A35s to his much-loved MGC27, often sailing with his wife Elly and daughter.<br><br>
      A safe pair of hands, a straight talker, and someone who knows how to get the best out of both boat and crew.
