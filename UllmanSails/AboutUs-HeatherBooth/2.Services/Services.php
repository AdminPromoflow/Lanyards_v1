    <h1>Canvas Maker</h1>
    <h2>Heather Booth</h2>
    <img src="2.Services/Image/SlideHome.jpg" alt="Heather Booth">
    <p>
      Heather is one of the quiet ones — she just gets on with the job, without fuss, and does it brilliantly. She’s not one to overpromise, but her canvas work speaks for itself: clean, precise, and often a perfect fit first time.<br><br>
      Canvas work requires calm, dry days for templating, which can be a challenge. Heather quietly panics (just a little) when the weather gets in the way — not because she’s unsure, but because she never wants to let a client down. And she rarely does. Many of her clients return year after year, knowing they’re in safe hands.<br><br>
      Outside the loft, Heather’s as driven as she is at work. She’s a keen swimmer, runner, and cyclist — and while she may not shout about it, she’s competed at a high level in triathlon, including World Championship events.<br><br>
      Steady, skilled, and incredibly dependable — we’re very proud to have her as part of the team.
