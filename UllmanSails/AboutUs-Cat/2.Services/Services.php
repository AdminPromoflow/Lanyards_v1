    <h1>Managing Director</h1>
    <h2>Catrina Southworth</h2>
      <img src="2.Services/Image/catrina-2.jpg" alt="">
    <p>I grew up sailing off the Isle of Wight, whether cruising with my father on his Evolution 19 or quite literally sailing my Topper around the Island. That early mix of racing and cruising gave me a love for the water — and a healthy respect for sails that are built to last.
Before Ullman Sails, I spent 28 years working with start-ups and growing businesses. I'm passionate about making sure clients get exactly what they’ve been promised, and that the team behind the product knows they’re part of something that works — ideally with a bit of humour and camaraderie along the way.<br><br>
In 2014, I had the chance to rekindle Ullman Sails in the UK. Sailors need kit that performs — whether for racing, cruising, or a bit of both. Your sails are your power. They're how you get where you're going, and they should be built to take you there again and again.
We don’t want clients forever chasing tweaks or returning to the loft. With proper care, a well-made sail will serve you for many hours of good sailing — and we’re here to make sure of it.<br><br>
It was a joy to meet Jon Pegg, and later Rob Larke — both share that same drive to make the client’s time on the water the best it can be.<br><br>
Jon brings deep knowledge of rig tuning and how it affects sail shape. He's also an experienced racer and is often found coaching on the water, helping boats find extra speed. Rob thrives on getting the most out of a team — and a boat. He works closely with our designers behind the scenes to make sure the sails are fast, reliable, and right for every boat.
Ullman Sails is now part of Warndon Sails — during COVID, we brought all our companies under one banner. When I’m not at work, you’ll probably find me helping our local Sea Scouts get out on the water, or in the background at one of the charity regattas on the Solent.
Whether you're racing or cruising, we’re here to help you enjoy your time on the water.</p>
