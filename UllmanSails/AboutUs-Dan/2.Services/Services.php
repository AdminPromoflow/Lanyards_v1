    <h1>Sailmaker</h1>
    <h2>Dan Crawford</h2>

    <p>
      Dan has been part of the team for over thirteen years. He joined us straight after university and made the move back to his hometown of Plymouth — where you’ll often find him on the bow of his dad’s Sunfast 32 *Mischief*, or in the loft repairing sails from the very same boat.<br><br>

      Dan heads up all our new sail builds in Plymouth. Quietly capable, he prefers sewing machines to phone calls — in fact, we don’t give him a phone, but we do make sure he’s got the right machine for every job (and there are quite a few of them!).<br><br>

      He’s recently taken a liking to the challenge of race-weary spinnakers — treating the post-regatta puzzle of putting one back together like a giant fabric jigsaw.<br><br>

      Steady, skilled, and completely unflappable, Dan just gets on with it — and we wouldn’t have it any other way.
