    <h2>Vicky Lawrence</h2>

    <p>
      Vicky is the one you'll most likely speak to when you call the Plympton loft — and the one who makes sure the rest of the team are doing what they need to, whether it’s getting sails race-ready or prepped for that all-important summer cruise.<br><br>
      She originally trained in canvas work, starting out on covers for canal boats before taking time out to raise her two boys. Now based in Plympton, Vicky works with us part-time (which, in our world, means four solid days a week — with a few well-earned extras off during the school holidays).<br><br>
      Vicky’s the quiet engine of the loft — she knows who’s doing what, where things are, and what needs chasing to keep everything on track. We’d be lost without her.
