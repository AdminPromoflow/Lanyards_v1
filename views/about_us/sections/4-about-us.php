  <p>Throughout history, branding has played a vital role in shaping identities
    and creating lasting impressions. From Babylonian stamped bricks in 300 BC
    to Roman Emperor Constantine’s use of coins marked with Christian symbols in
    312 AD, and from George Washington’s commemorative buttons in the 18th
    century to Busch Brewery equipping its sales teams with branded tools in
    the 19th century, promotional branding has always been a powerful means of
    communication.</p>
