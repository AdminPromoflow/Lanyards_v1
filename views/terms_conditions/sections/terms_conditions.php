  <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

  <p>By placing an order with Lanyards For You, you agree to these terms and conditions. We are not responsible for any failure or delay in fulfilling our obligations due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control.</p>

<h2>Website Content</h2>
<p>Products displayed on our website may include company logos for illustrative purposes. This does not necessarily imply that we have supplied these products to those companies. Additionally, our website may contain links to third-party websites over which we have no control and for which we assume no responsibility.</p>

<h2>Quotations</h2>
<p>Quotations will be sent directly from our website. If there are discrepancies, such as a design with more colours than quoted or a change in the lanyard style to better fit the logo, we will re-quote and request the corresponding additional payment. All quotations and orders are subject to final artwork review.</p>

<h2>Prices</h2>
<p>Prices displayed on the website are approximate and may be adjusted based on order requirements or unforeseen additional costs. The final quotation will be confirmed after receiving the artwork and full specifications. All prices are subject to VAT at the prevailing rate.</p>

<h2>Payment</h2>
<p>Existing account holders must make full payment within 30 days of invoice issuance unless otherwise agreed. For new accounts, full payment is required at the time of placing the order. Online and telephone payments are accepted.</p>

<h2>Late Payments</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to charge a 5% monthly interest on overdue invoices and legal costs in case of collection actions. No new orders will be processed until the account is settled.</p>

<h2>Products and Images</h2>
<p>We make every effort to accurately describe products, but we do not guarantee absolute accuracy. Designs and images may change without prior notice due to manufacturer modifications.</p>

<h2>Samples</h2>
<p>We can provide lanyard samples free of charge upon request.</p>

<h2>Quantity and Tolerance</h2>
<p>The final delivered quantity may vary by 5% from the ordered quantity, in accordance with industry standards. The invoiced amount will reflect the delivered quantity. If the customer needs to modify the quantity before production, they must request it in writing.</p>

<h2>Small Orders</h2>
<p>We may accept orders smaller than the published minimums on our website, but additional charges may apply.</p>

<h2>Colours</h2>
<p>We strive to match Pantone colours or provided samples as closely as possible, with a tolerance of +/- 10%.</p>

<h2>Artwork</h2>
<p>If the provided design quality is insufficient for clear printing, we may modify or redraw it. Changes will be communicated before printing, and additional charges may apply.</p>

<h2>Trademarks and Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>By providing us with a logo, image, or design, you guarantee that you have the rights to use and distribute it. Lanyards For You is not responsible for third-party claims related to intellectual property.</p>

<h2>Order Confirmation</h2>
<p>A proof of the design will be sent for final approval before production. We are not responsible for errors discovered after approval.</p>

<h2>Claims</h2>
<p>If you receive damaged products during shipping, you must notify us within 24 hours of receipt so we can file a claim with the carrier.</p>

<h2>Returns</h2>
<p>Returns are only accepted for defective products. We do not accept returns of printed lanyards if the error is due to an approved design. Plain stock lanyards are non-returnable due to event-related usage.</p>

<h2>Cancellations</h2>
<p>Cancelled orders are subject to charges based on the work completed. If pre-production samples have been made, they will be charged accordingly. If artwork has been produced, a cancellation fee of Â£35.00 will apply.</p>

<h2>Delivery and Lead Times</h2>
<p>Delivery times vary by product. Express delivery may be available for additional fees. We are not responsible for delays beyond our control, such as customs clearance or adverse weather conditions.</p>

<h2>Ownership and Risk</h2>
<p>Risk transfers to the buyer upon delivery, but Lanyards For You retains ownership until full payment is received. In case of non-payment, we reserve the right to reclaim the products.</p>

<h2>Liability</h2>
<p>Our liability for any loss or damage resulting from product supply is limited to the value of the goods. We are not responsible for indirect or consequential losses.</p>

<h2>Force Majeure</h2>
<p>We are not liable for failure to fulfil obligations due to circumstances beyond our control, such as strikes, natural disasters, war, fire, flood, or supplier issues.</p>

<h2>Security Policy</h2>
<p>At Lanyards For You, we are committed to protecting the privacy and security of our users. When users create an account or use third-party login services such as Facebook and Google, we only collect essential information, such as name and email address. All passwords are securely stored using encryption, ensuring that your credentials are protected at all times.</p>
<p>Currently, we do not employ active monitoring systems to detect unauthorised access, but we follow best security practices to protect the information of our users. We do not use cookies nor track users' behaviour on our website.</p>
<p>It is important to note that, in the future, we may integrate third-party providers, such as promoflow.net, to process orders. In this case, we ensure that any information shared with these providers will be handled with the same confidentiality and security measures we implement internally.</p>
<p>We strive to provide a secure and transparent environment for our users, and remain committed to continuously improving our security practices.</p>

<h2>Customer Communication</h2>
<p>We may contact customers via email regarding website updates or changes in products and services.</p>
