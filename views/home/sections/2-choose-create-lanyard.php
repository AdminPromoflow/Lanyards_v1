        <h2>Begin with Material Selection for Unique Lanyards</h2>
        <p>We have these materials for you:</p>

        <h3>Flat Polyester</h3>
        <p>It is the most standard of our lanyards. They are available in a wide range of colours and are available for fast turnaround orders. Print them one side or both and add a huge range of attachements.
        </p>

        <h3>Tube Polyester</h3>
        <p>
           This material is popular for its elasticity, durability, and moisture-wicking properties, making it a favored choice in sportswear and activewear manufacturing. </p>

        <h3>Dyed Bamboo and Natural Bamboo: </h3>
        <p>These lanyards are created bamboo fibres. Bamboo is a fast growing plant that doesnâ€™t use much water. It releases much more oxygen into the atmosphere than trees and can also improve soil quality and help reduce erosion. </p>

        <h3>Recycled PET</h3>
        <p>These lanyards are created from 100% recycled PET drink bottles that would otherwise end up in landfill sites. When you are finished using them, remove any attachments, put them in a recycling bin and start the whole process again! </p>

        <h3>Dye-sublimation and Dye-sub Recycled PET</h3>
        <p>These lanyards are printed using a high temperature transfer process which is capable of producing full colour, CMYK, photographic images. And with 100% coverage as standard the whole thing can be used for your branding.</p>

        <h3>Woven</h3>
        <p>Woven lanyards are made to order from different colour threads, which means that the pattern is embedded into the layard itself </p>
